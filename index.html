            <p>
              The Hangman Game was done using pure HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
              technologies. I am successfulyl integrated the functionality of
              Dark/Light Theme on the website, so that can be using in any time
              of the day for better viewing. Furthermore, it has the logistics
              of counting letters, win or lose ending and main screen to start
              the game. While playing, a bunch of functionality is on, to make
              sure game goes right way, so it is impossible to cheat.

            <p>
              To Do List was my second project that I have been working on. As
              well as Hangman Game, I was using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript in
              order to build this app. It has fantastic features, for instance
              saving of the todo's. This is done by connecting requests to
              LocalStorage, so whatever user wrote in the todo's will be saved
              until user personally deletes it. Furthermore, it has a couple of
              functionalities like delete the todo, or mark it done, if that
              clicked the todo is changing color and gets a linethrough the
              text, so it can be differentiated from undone todo's.

              Spoon: represents a landing page a small business restaurant.
              There are available food choices, location and booking. The page
              is done with modern technologies e.g React via ViteJS and SCSS.
              This is done because its simplifies the overall work, as we have a
              lot of reusable components like buttons, cards, etc. This is the
              great and first experience of breaking down React as a tool.

            <p>
              This is my third project, that taught me to the JavaScript, it has
              a great functionality of rolling the dice, where user can see the
              dice rolling and showing the number. Furthermore, I have done the
              button, so that user can hold his number and pass the move to the
              next player. During the game, there are logic, if the active
              player drops number one on the dice, the move automatically
              transfers to the next player as written in the rules of the game.
              Moreover, who first gets 60 point, wins the game. I have add a
              color scheme of active (gray) and holding (blue), so players can
              differentiate who's move is next.
